## Project Description:

(insert name here) is an application that allows users to enter, and search for quotes from their favorite pseudo celebrities, the Kardashians. (insert name here) also allows users to comment on quotes and enter blog-like posts. The website is gated behind a registration system. New users will be able to view the index page which will contain a 'quote of the day' and a sign up/log in prompt. If the user does neither of these things, they will always be re-directed to the index page.

After signing up/logging in, users will be able to comment on posts, enter their own quotes, search quotes, and write blog posts.
